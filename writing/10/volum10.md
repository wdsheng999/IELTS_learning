>Dear Sir or Madam,
Me and my friends had a wonderful dinner at your restaurant. How to say that, when I went to have the same steak at my place, I was wondering how hard cooking something can really be. It's just using the best meat that I have, with all the thing and little secretes from the recipe, after all this that I could only figure out what a great job that you have done to those beef. They are just amazing. So, last Thursday night, while hanging for a rather long time wondering the exhibition held by my friend Jack, with the mask on for a very long time, still trying to respond to people's questions, Jack suggested to have some well-cooked meat to fill us up, also to celebrate the success and completion of the long lasted event. 
Your steak house is of an exotic genre, from the outside we thought it's a good whisky bar, but with no expectation for the food. However, your professionalism just shocked us down. The wine, the music, together mixed with the aroma from the food... Just as fantastic and surprise as you gave to us! We really have to admit that you're a total genius.
Thanks again for the meal, as all the experiences. Also looking forward for your craft beer as well.
Best wishes,
Joseph

>Toys are one of the sweet memories for all of us when enjoying our worriless and innocent kids' moments. It's well noticed that, parents tend to buy a large number of toys, which benefits from the development of modern industry, however can be a challenge of environment in the future.
Toys are sweet, they are designed and developed ever back in long last history. Children are actually learning by playing toys, no matter it's a car or a barbie doll. Kids are developing their little brain in the progress of playing the toys they are given, by interacting with these little things. Also, toys are librating the parents from being "the toy" of their kids. So, the reason for parents to buy a lot of toys are clear, not to mention their love for the kid and under their begging for a lot of times.
Toys also have their problem once it's given to much. Like learning, you never learned only if you dig deep enough into one thing rather than take overviews of one thousand. Kids can be easily satisfied when given new gift, but they never learned from simple asking. With more stuff created in the market, we also create billions of waste and pollution to the environment. Kids are growing up and getting boring of their last toy, but environment can't really take too much.
However, in my opinion, toys are positive, especially in a world full of computer games. What I'm thinking of a great resolution is a proper combination of both computer and real toys, that parents should never leaning much over to only one side.

>Dear Paul,
As I told you, my application to the technology institute is permitted. I plan to finish a master degree in design of calculation and computer science for like two year. Thanks to the help with the applying materials and also, your native language skills.
So, by the time of next autumn, I'm coming to London to start my new semester. I plan to look for a part-time job in spare time, because you know, I'm not the type of person who can stay alone at the computer for a whole day. I think that some exercise and communication with local folks would be a very good opportunity to get into contact with this brand new environment for me. Since you have started your career in London, I'm very in need of your advice.
I don't think that I should start to work in the Internet companies, since it's just a part-time job and I really don't want it to be very complicated and consumes a lot of energy everyday. What do you think of work in a gym? Some time of free work out is also a benefit. Would you help me to look for some part-time jobs that you think I'm competent.
Your Sincerely,
Joseph

### topic 2

>As is stated, the crime rate is raising among the majority of countries, which usually happens to mostly undeveloped nations like countries in Africa of South America, where the drugs and gangsters become a problem along the modern history. But now, even in countries like the US, more and more crime problems have become a serious society issue under both parties' concern.
For most undeveloped countries, there is hardly a strong and powerful government who can take care of citizens' public security. Public security is a basic but fundamental structure in the nation's governance. Poor countries are often in short hands of social resources, and often not in good status when establishing the country ever since. Like the bases of a building, the public security issue becomes more of a problem once the country started to heading for economic growth, as if the building goes higher, the unstable bases cause an evident shake on top.
However, things are not the same in developed countries, especially for US, and other old, well-developed nations in EU. These countries are mostly bothered with illegal immigrants and drug dealing problems, which are often from the outside, from those poor and undeveloped countries as we mentioned above. In today's world, it's hard to step aside and only focusing on domestic economic development, a stable and peaceful global environment is also required, which I believe is more important for the developed ones.
In all, to deal with the crime issue is not a domestic problem. Powerful countries should work together to create a better cross-country global relation as we founded  UN last century, so that countries can communicate and really come to deal with crime issue.

### ans to 2: but a bad answer
>I am going to write about how the amount of crime is increasing in many countries and why.
Nowadays there are many countries has increasing on the amount of crime and I think the problem is that mast of the crime has done by the young people which is under 18 and from the age you can see and you can understand what is going on but in my opinion I think the main causes is the family and the school,the family I mean th mom an dad they have to look after their teenagers until they grow up and do not le them watch films which has a fight or blood, the school is the same as the second house for the teenagers and they have to teach them how to grow up in good way and teach them how to respect the old people.
For example I have been told from my oldest brother that in the UK 2 years ago a boy from Qatar he is l years old has Killed by groups of teenagers in Haisting and the killed him without any reasons and when the Police asked them why did you do that they said we want to show of we are the best.So you can say they learn from the action movies.
Finally I hope all the people can help the teenagers to give them advice and to let the know what will happen after the crime Also in schools they must teach them how to avoid the bad movies and to grow up in safe way

### comment on ans2
>Both parts of the prompt are addressed,although the main ideas and the writer's
position could be better developed. No clear conclusions are drawn so there is a
lack of overall progression.Organisation is evident but not always logical,and the
sentences are not fluently linked to each other,while each paragraph lacks a clear
topic.**The vocabulary is limited but minimally adequate**,with not much variation
in expression,and the frequent **spelling errors** are noticeable and cause some
difficulty for the reader.**The range of sentence types is limited and rather repetitive**
Complex sentences are attempted but tend to be faulty,and there are a number of
basic errors.Punctuation is poorly controlled,with underuse of capital letters and
fullstops                                          .
