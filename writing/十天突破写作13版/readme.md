## 4️⃣Building a sound structure
大作文: Report/Argument
Report: 不给观点 只给现象 分析 15-25%
cause原因/solution解决方案/problem带来的问题/factors影响因素/measures应对措施/effects(influence impact)影响 等

### Argument: 辩论观点 比较利弊
有四种提问方式 
- 双方讨论   high --> discuss both views, give opinion 
- 是否同意   high --> do u agree or not/ to what extent
- 比较利弊   mid  --> advantages, disadvantages/ benefits, drawbacks
- 你怎么看   low  --> what's ur opinion/ view?

#### argument 四段式
1. 1-3  句   写一个简洁的开头段 1：介绍社会背景 2 转述题目话题 3 陈述自己态度
2. 1+5-6  论述自己更倾向的一方 1 提分论点1 展开支持 重点句子 2 分论点2 展开支持 前两个论点充分过长的时候不需要写第三个论点 否则分论点三并支持
3. 1+3-4  让步端 论述自己不太倾向的一方 1 概括这个观点 2 提出理由reason1 并展开支持 3 reason2 并展开支持/或者提出reason1的不严密指出进一步弱化让步段的观点 两种写法占2/3 1/3 
4. 1-2 结尾段 1 概括让步段里不太倾向的一方 可以与第二句话合并为一句话 2 重申自己更加倾向的一方 3 提出政府/媒体/等主题应该怎样做的建议 如果想不出建议的可以省略 但结尾段同样要不能偏题

TODO: 作为english as a second language(ESL)考试, ielts考试的作文并不需要深刻 各分论点及支持句不需要曲高和寡 只求common sense, 语言清楚准确即可
在 day6 中有详细的论述

#### argument 五段式
2 3 两段都写倾向方 倾向方给出两段 让步段一段 

总结: 四段式 适合分论点多 但supporting sentences少的情况
五段式 适合论点少 但是 支持句较多的情况 

### report结构
1. 概括背景和目的 1 介绍社会/自然背景 可选 2 改写需要分析的话题 3 说明本文要分析现象的成因和解决方案
2. 分析现象产生的原因/带来的问题etc 由题目决定 1 原因是什么 可选 2 第一个原因 3 supporting sentence 不超过两句 4 第二个 5 supporting sentence 然后是可选的第三个原因以及支持句 
3. 分析现象的解决方案/带来的effect等 由题目决定 1 说明本段的解决方案 2 第一个解决方案 3 解释支持 4 第二个解决方案 5解释支持 第三个可选
4. 结尾段做总结 1 概括现象的成因 2 概括相应措施

### 混搭结构 
既不是严格的report 也不是严格的argument
>The way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In wha ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make?Has this been a positive or negative development?

第一个问题是现象的affect是什么 属于典型的report 
第二个问题是比较利弊 属于典型的argument

解决: 分别用一个主体段落来回应argument 和report 接可以了 
其实更容易满足字数要求


## 5️⃣ the generation of ideas
与GRE写作有本质的区别 GRE要求insightful 
而ielts是语言能力测试 只要求具有适当说理的能力 对于ideas本身的质量和论述要求只是reasonable 而不是profound
短时间 通顺 地道的表达

i.e.  下面每道题看三遍 确定主体段里的分论点 即ideas
>In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem?

显然是先report再argument
para1: 1 natural resources 2 stable society 3 weather 
para2: 1 dams, hydraulic conservation 2 good strong government 3 environmental friendly

>In a number of countries,some people think it is necessary to spend large sum of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

argument
para1: leaning to constructing new lines. 1 modern transportation system should put into use, which is a promotion in both scientific and engineering field 2 time-saving, providing more conveniences to the citizens. also good for commercial activities 3 construction investment as a government policy to cut down growing inflation
para2: 1 improving existence is not helping with the convenience but could actually affect normal transportation, but new ones will not affect old during the construction. 2 not that cost-saving, as a engineer, some parts are out-of-date, which is even more expensive to buy or produce. 
end: improving existing transportation is against the development of technology. nowadays public transportation in big old cities are far from the advanced technology. it's not a cost-effective job to do. So I am suggesting to build new public transportation instead. It's not only good for the citizens, but also a strong support to the development of new technology.

>Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country.Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion

argument
it is.
1 a long time to learn, but the output is rare. 2 the development of translation AI technology. 3 
1 obviously a lot reasons, but which is the main one? we should focus on the main issue. because life is short. if you are not involved in the other country for a least reason, which is to travel, study or work there, why bother to learn? if you are deeply in love with the culture and the history, at least you should be there.

>Many museums charge for admission while others are free.Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?

argument
outweigh 
para1  1 better preservation for the artifacts 2 keep the museum a pure place like a library, less commercial activities in the museum 3
