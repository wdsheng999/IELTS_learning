day3 练习

## 4️⃣Building a sound structure
大作文: Report/Argument
Report: 不给观点 只给现象 分析 15-25%
cause原因/solution解决方案/problem带来的问题/factors影响因素/measures应对措施/effects(influence impact)影响 等

### Argument: 辩论观点 比较利弊
有四种提问方式 
- 双方讨论   high --> discuss both views, give opinion 
- 是否同意   high --> do u agree or not/ to what extent
- 比较利弊   mid  --> advantages, disadvantages/ benefits, drawbacks
- 你怎么看   low  --> what's ur opinion/ view?

#### argument 四段式
1. 1-3  句   写一个简洁的开头段 1：介绍社会背景 2 转述题目话题 3 陈述自己态度
2. 1+5-6  论述自己更倾向的一方 1 提分论点1 展开支持 重点句子 2 分论点2 展开支持 前两个论点充分过长的时候不需要写第三个论点 否则分论点三并支持
3. 1+3-4  让步端 论述自己不太倾向的一方 1 概括这个观点 2 提出理由reason1 并展开支持 3 reason2 并展开支持/或者提出reason1的不严密指出进一步弱化让步段的观点 两种写法占2/3 1/3 
4. 1-2 结尾段 1 概括让步段里不太倾向的一方 可以与第二句话合并为一句话 2 重申自己更加倾向的一方 3 提出政府/媒体/等主题应该怎样做的建议 如果想不出建议的可以省略 但结尾段同样要不能偏题

TODO: 作为english as a second language(ESL)考试, ielts考试的作文并不需要深刻 各分论点及支持句不需要曲高和寡 只求common sense, 语言清楚准确即可
在 day6 中有详细的论述

#### argument 五段式
2 3 两段都写倾向方 倾向方给出两段 让步段一段 

总结: 四段式 适合分论点多 但supporting sentences少的情况
五段式 适合论点少 但是 支持句较多的情况 

### report结构
1. 概括背景和目的 1 介绍社会/自然背景 可选 2 改写需要分析的话题 3 说明本文要分析现象的成因和解决方案
2. 分析现象产生的原因/带来的问题etc 由题目决定 1 原因是什么 可选 2 第一个原因 3 supporting sentence 不超过两句 4 第二个 5 supporting sentence 然后是可选的第三个原因以及支持句 
3. 分析现象的解决方案/带来的effect等 由题目决定 1 说明本段的解决方案 2 第一个解决方案 3 解释支持 4 第二个解决方案 5解释支持 第三个可选
4. 结尾段做总结 1 概括现象的成因 2 概括相应措施

### 混搭结构 
既不是严格的report 也不是严格的argument
>The way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In wha ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make?Has this been a positive or negative development?

第一个问题是现象的affect是什么 属于典型的report 
第二个问题是比较利弊 属于典型的argument

解决: 分别用一个主体段落来回应argument 和report 接可以了 
其实更容易满足字数要求


## 5️⃣ the generation of ideas
与GRE写作有本质的区别 GRE要求insightful 
而ielts是语言能力测试 只要求具有适当说理的能力 对于ideas本身的质量和论述要求只是reasonable 而不是profound
短时间 通顺 地道的表达

i.e.  下面每道题看三遍 确定主体段里的分论点 即ideas
>In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem?

显然是先report再argument
para1: 1 natural resources 2 stable society 3 weather 
para2: 1 dams, hydraulic conservation 2 good strong government 3 environmental friendly

>In a number of countries,some people think it is necessary to spend large sum of money on constructing new railway lines for very fast trains between cities. Others believe the money should be spent on improving existing public transport. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

argument
para1: leaning to constructing new lines. 1 modern transportation system should put into use, which is a promotion in both scientific and engineering field 2 time-saving, providing more conveniences to the citizens. also good for commercial activities 3 construction investment as a government policy to cut down growing inflation
para2: 1 improving existence is not helping with the convenience but could actually affect normal transportation, but new ones will not affect old during the construction. 2 not that cost-saving, as a engineer, some parts are out-of-date, which is even more expensive to buy or produce. 
end: improving existing transportation is against the development of technology. nowadays public transportation in big old cities are far from the advanced technology. it's not a cost-effective job to do. So I am suggesting to build new public transportation instead. It's not only good for the citizens, but also a strong support to the development of new technology.

>Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country.Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion

argument
it is.
1 a long time to learn, but the output is rare. 2 the development of translation AI technology. 3 
1 obviously a lot reasons, but which is the main one? we should focus on the main issue. because life is short. if you are not involved in the other country for a least reason, which is to travel, study or work there, why bother to learn? if you are deeply in love with the culture and the history, at least you should be there.

>Many museums charge for admission while others are free.Do you think the advantages of charging people for admission to museums outweigh the disadvantages?

argument
outweigh 
para1  1 better preservation for the artifacts 2 keep the museum a pure place like a library, less commercial activities in the museum 3

#### 第二题🍕
剑 著名难题
>Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others,however,think that the circumstances of a crime,and the motivation for committing it,should always be taken into account.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion

看到复杂的话题不必紧张 记得考核的要求是准确合理的表达而不是过度的追求哲理 扣题的素材就是好素材
从效率的角度出发 fixed punishment 好处很多 
>improve the efficiency of the court process
deter the criminals
reduce the lawsuits costs

从权责的角度出发 烤炉罪犯的处境 circumstances and motivation的好处如下 可以写在让步段

>权力: respect the civil right of criminals
责任: more responsible judgement and more convincing

## 6️⃣clarity counts 展开支持句
### 何为好的论述 what is well supported?
缺乏展开的分论点会被考官判为 lack of development / not well supported

不要把支持据想的太高端了 似是而非的深奥 高雅 曲折 
下面对着分论点展开一到三句supporting sentences

1. An advantage of going to school at an early age is that children develop faster socially.


S: The ability to grow socially is all about the right timing. Kids are developing their personality during mutual connection such as playing games and meeting new friends. 

Model answer:
1-They make friends and learn how to get on with other children of a similar age.
2-This is often not possible at home because their brother or sisters are older or younger.
高分范文的支持句往往都很通俗易懂

2. People are more active in their sixties and seventies than they used to be.
S:One reason is that the elderly today often have a better health state due to the medical development. Another reason is that the development of internet brings more social occasions for old people.


Model answer:
1-They have time to enjoy their retirement and do activities that they could not do when they were at work.
2-They can also help to look after their grandchildren, which is a great benefit for working parents.

看穿了语言能力测试的本质 就是要用清晰 正确的语言表达 支持句就不再是拦路虎

### native speakers怎么展开支持句
展开支持句使全文最能体现实力的real content. 一头雾水的原因是不理解英语国家的议论文写作教学过程。只要明白了native speakers的思考过程 立刻就能明白怎么展开零考官满意的支持句了

why is this true?/分论点为什么成立？ 这么说的理由是什么
what dose this mean?/分论点这样将的意思是？如何更好的阐述

#### why is this true?
分论点： playing violent video games can cause changes in young people's behavior.

1.why? the game makes it fun to fight and kill.
2.They also teach young people to use violence to solve problems
3.As a result, many young people become aggressive towards their teachers classmates and even their parents.

分论点：extreme sports involve high risks.

1.for example,bungee jumpers need to jump from very high places.
2.they may be seriously injured if the equipment does not work well.

分论点：higher taxes should be put on fast food.

1.fast food has underestimated threat for peoples' health. like cigarette, we should tax them in order to warn people about it.
3.fast food is also a charming food source that people would be addicted to, which can be a reliable and stable tax source for the government.

> 1. the health care system spends a large part of money on health problems caused by fast food.
> 2. People who have these problems should be responsible for the their own choice of food.
> 3. the extra taxes that they pay can help to improve the health care system.

#### what does this mean?
这种方法比上一个问题问的少一些， 但是如果感觉到分论点的概括比较抽象， 可以这样展开
分论点：school uniforms help to reduce economic and social differences.
1.they try to make all student feel equal and confident.
2.Uniforms also reduce the pressure on low-income parents to buy fashionable clothes for their children.

分论点：art skills are not essential skills that most students will need when they  enter the job market. essential skill比较抽象 通过提问可以展开支持句
1.Most of them will not need to draw or paint at work.
2.Other skills, such as language, maths and computer skills, can help to prepare them better for their future  careers.
通过把essential skills具体化来进行支持， 如果完全跟着题目的essential走的话， 很难在较短的篇幅中对这个概念进行清晰的阐述。于是， 这个问题的策略在于利用实例化来对目标进行支持。

### 连接词
如何使支持局读起来流畅自然， 需要使用连接词 cohesive devices.
> use a range of cohesive devices appropriately, but not every line needs one.
请看下面的官方示例
分论点：Government should encourage the use of public transportation.
**They** can make public transport more convenient and affordable. Buses, trams and trains are good ways of commuting and getting around. **This means that** more people will use them **if** they are cheaper and more reliable.
