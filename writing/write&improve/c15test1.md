In general, the chart shows that Brisbane and Adelaide are having less percentage of people consuming tea or coffee. And we can see a trend of preference on going to the cafe in most cities. The percentage of this  item alone can take up to 60% in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart.  Well in Brisbane it is a little ovet 55%, but in Adelaide, which is the least, this is lower than 50%. And Adelaide is the only city where the percetage of resident choose to buy instant coffe than actually going to a cafe, which can be regraded as unusual among Australia.

The percentage of buying fresh coffee is the least in all cities.  We could probably guess that it is not as convenient as instant coffee and customers would have to wait for a considerably period of time. However, when people actually get some time, they would consider going to a cafe to kill some time.

In conclusion, habits of coffee and tea buying and drinking vary from different cities in Australia, but also have something in common among all the cities.

The chart illustrates the coffee and tea buying and drinking habits of people in five Australian cities. It compares the percentage of residents who bought fresh coffee, instant coffee, and the number of times they went to a cafe in the last four weeks.

Overall, it can be seen that the percentage of people who went to a cafe in the last four weeks is the highest among all three categories in all cities except Adelaide. In Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, this percentage can reach up to 60%, while in Brisbane it is slightly over 55%. In contrast, Adelaide has the lowest percentage of people who went to a cafe in the last four weeks, at less than 50%.

Interestingly, Adelaide is also the only city where the percentage of residents who bought instant coffee is higher than those who went to a cafe. This could suggest that residents in Adelaide prefer the convenience of instant coffee over going to a cafe.

In terms of fresh coffee purchases, the percentage is relatively low in all cities. This could indicate that buying fresh coffee is not as popular as going to a cafe or buying instant coffee.

In conclusion, the chart shows that there are some variations in coffee and tea buying and drinking habits among different cities in Australia. However, going to a cafe seems to be a common preference among residents in most cities.

In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people.Why might this be the case?Do you think this is a positive or negative situation?

---

When it comes to house owning, different countries take different views. But in some countries that people tend to own a house rather than renting one. This is considered as an important factor of people due to some of the following reasons in my opinion.One reason is that owing a house shows the economic wealth in general. In most cities, houses are the most recognized real estate and it usually would take a large amount of fortune to purchase one. So owning a house shows one person is finacially independent and usually has a success in career, which is important to value people's position in society.Another reason is that if we think it over, if the society has a complete and healthy distribution system and takes care of every one, people will be less anxious about owning a house so it can be a much less important aspect of valuing a person.  So, the level of importance a house is regarded for people is actually a sign of great gap between the rich and the poor, because only a few people are capable of owning a house.So, in my opinion, this is a rather negative sign of cosidering a house as much  an important aspect for a person. Some greatest person never really own a house ever, even they are far richer than posessing some of the nicest ones. I think in a healthy society, house is just like other necessitis in life, is something everyone can have, but not a tool designed for making people feel much of a burden, which in some countries, young people would have to pay the mortgage for 20 or 30 years, spending their whole life on it. In conclusion, house is important in people's lives but I think it should not be taken so serious as in some countries. People should love their lives, not their houses alone.p

当然可以。下面是一篇7.5分以上的雅思写作示范：

In some countries, owning a home is considered more important than renting one. There are several reasons why this might be the case.

One reason is that owning a home can provide a sense of security and stability. When people own their own home, they have control over their living environment and do not have to worry about rent increases or eviction. This can provide peace of mind and a sense of permanence.

Another reason is that owning a home can be seen as a sign of financial success and social status. In many societies, homeownership is associated with wealth and success. Owning a home can also provide a sense of accomplishment and pride.

However, whether this situation is positive or negative depends on the individual and the society in which they live. On the one hand, homeownership can provide many benefits, such as security and stability. On the other hand, placing too much emphasis on homeownership can create pressure and stress for those who are unable to afford it.

In conclusion, the importance placed on homeownership varies from country to country and from individual to individual. While it can provide many benefits, it is important for societies to ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing, regardless of whether they own or rent.
