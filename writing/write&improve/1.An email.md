Dear Alex,
I'm so sorry that I cannot come to your party on Saturday. This is totally unexpected and I have to write for your excuse.
The reason for my absense is that there is an urgent call from my doctor Jeff that he suggest to meet me in person and he is going to leave town for quite a long time. Jeff and his family will go on a trip on Sunday and he would have the last meeting for my throat hurting problem, which you know, has been a lot better since Jeff took my case. So, I will have to visit Jeff and thank him for all the efforts he made and of course, take some final suggestions.
It's a great pity not going to the party, I know, we've been planning this for a month and again, I feel so sorry and hope you can understand me, I really need Jeff's support. And I'm thinking about hold another party next time at my house and hope it can conpensate next time.
Yours,
Joseph
