你的作文总体来说写得不错。你对图表中的信息进行了很好的总结和比较。但是，你的作文中有一些语法和用词方面的问题。

例如，在第二段中，你写道：“We can see most of students choose full-time jobs and 12% of students don’t get employed, but there are also another 8% of students remains unknown so the overall employment rate is about 80%。”这句话中，“most of students”应该改为“most students”，“another 8% of students remains unknown”应该改为“another 8% of students remain unknown”。

此外，在第三段中，你写道：“The salary range of government sector are tending to be higer.”这句话中，“are tending to be higer”应该改为“tends to be higher”。

总体来说，你的作文得分为6分。希望我的建议能够帮助你改进写作技能。😊

## essay2

In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message?

---

It is a known fact that children are told to be capable to do anything as long as they work hard enough. This culture can be positve and negative in different eyes.

As for the advantages, children are gaining lots of confidence if they were told to achieve their dreams in their young ages. Kids are of great possibilities, they should be brave enough to go for whatever dreams they have and as adults, for example, teachers and parents, it is their responsibility to encourage their children, help them become brave men with dreams. This is a postitve environment for kids to have postitive actitude towards life and success. They will work hard, and gain a certain amount of success while growing up.

But this can also be bad, or even harmful, if the grown up keeps telling so. It is important to tell kids to work hard, to let them be brave, but it is more important for kids to be strong. We should also let kids know that there are things probably never achieved. It is okay to give up sometimes. Being strong and resilient means you should know when to withdraw and keep some strength for more meaningful things. If you are in a dead end of road, it's not a shame to come back. In this situation, too much burden and blame for not working hard enough can be harmful for children's psychological health.

当然可以。下面是一篇7.5分以上的作文供你参考：

In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough. While this message can have some positive effects, it also has its drawbacks.

On the one hand, telling children that they can achieve anything through hard work can be a powerful motivator. It can encourage them to set high goals for themselves and to strive to reach their full potential. This message can also help to build children’s self-confidence and resilience, as they learn to overcome obstacles and persevere in the face of challenges.

On the other hand, this message can also have some negative consequences. For one thing, it can create unrealistic expectations and set children up for disappointment and frustration. Not everyone can achieve everything they want, no matter how hard they try. Furthermore, this message can put undue pressure on children to succeed, leading to stress and anxiety.

In conclusion, while telling children that they can achieve anything through hard work has its advantages, it is important to balance this message with a realistic understanding of the limitations and challenges that everyone faces. By doing so, we can help children to develop a healthy and positive attitude towards achievement and success.
