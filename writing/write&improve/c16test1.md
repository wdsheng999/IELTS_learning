>这是题目：The charts below show the changes in ownership of electrical appliances and amount of time spent doing housework in households in one country between 1920 and 2019. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

>In the comparision between the hours of housework and the percentage of electrical appliances, we can see a big trend of working hours declining with the population of all kinds of domestic appliances. After a century, the number of hours doing housework per week has gone from approximately 50 hours to 10, which means about 40 hours of housework labour is saved, which is often token by women, that is a huge progress of improvement that the development of technology helps to free human labour.
 The we take a closer look into the data of different catagories of household appliances. First is refrigerator, which is invented around 1920 and rapidly accepted by all families for its irreplacable use of keeping food fresh. Vacuum cleaner is another item that every familly keeps at their home at around 2000. But we can see that the washing machine is until now not been owned 100 percent by all families. And it is also the only appliance that had been through a decline in the 1960s, perhaps caused by energy prise and water shortage. And we can tell that from common sense, some of the clothes are not suitable for machine wash, which is another reason.


>Thank you for sharing your essay with me. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your writing:

 Introduction: Your introduction should provide an overview of the main features of the charts and indicate what comparisons you will be making. However, your introduction does not mention the ownership of electrical appliances, which is a key aspect of the charts. Also, it would be better to start with a clearer thesis statement that summarizes your main points.

 Lack of data: You mention the decline in hours spent on housework, but you do not provide any data to support this claim. It would be better to use specific figures from the charts to illustrate the trend.

 Use of language: There are several grammar and vocabulary mistakes in your essay. For example, "often token" should be "often taken," "that is a huge progress of improvement" should be "which represents significant progress," and "catagories" should be "categories." It is important to proofread your work carefully and use appropriate vocabulary and grammar to convey your ideas clearly.

 Organization: Your essay would benefit from better organization. It is important to separate the different aspects of the charts and focus on each one separately. In addition, you should provide more specific details and examples to support your arguments.

 Overall, your essay shows potential, but there is room for improvement. I hope these suggestions will be helpful in refining your writing.

当然可以。以下是一篇符合雅思7.5分以上标准的作文：

The charts illustrate the changes in ownership of electrical appliances and the amount of time spent on housework in households in one country between 1920 and 2019.

Overall, it is clear that as the ownership of electrical appliances increased, the amount of time spent on housework decreased significantly. In 1920, households spent approximately 50 hours per week on housework, while the ownership of electrical appliances was almost non-existent. By 2019, however, the average time spent on housework had decreased to just 10 hours per week, while the ownership of all types of electrical appliances had reached nearly 100%.

In terms of specific appliances, the refrigerator was the first to be widely owned by households, with ownership reaching 100% by around 1950. The vacuum cleaner followed a similar trend, with ownership reaching 100% by around 2000. The washing machine, on the other hand, experienced a decline in ownership in the 1960s before gradually increasing again. Even by 2019, however, not all households owned a washing machine.

In conclusion, the charts show a clear correlation between the increasing ownership of electrical appliances and the decreasing amount of time spent on housework. This suggests that technological advancements have played a significant role in reducing the burden of housework on households.

## essay2

你还要帮我修改这一篇，按照上面的打分和修改要求。题目是In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?

The reason for people started to find out the stories behind the building they live in is a pure result of curiosity, especially in places with much history remains. For example in my city, which is famous in ancient history, there are so many old things around us and they are actually recorded in textbooks. If you are in such environment, no doubt you can be fasinated by finding out the history behind what you see everyday and to imagine the same feeling of seeing the same view of some famous historical figures once did. That is a poetic feeling of culture. Another reason can be for the memorial purpose of the family ancesters. Maybe the house is built by a great grandfather from somewhere far away to move to a new place or it is an very old house that has the same age as the family. It is these stories that come up together to shape people's view of the whole family. It can also be the reason for doing research. I think this question alone can be a perfect thesis for taking the kids and give them a very first course of doing research. It is relevent for everyone and it can never be authenticated by some super power so everyone can hold their view and make their own decisions, unless you really live in some places as famous as the white house. As we talk about doing research, we need to know how to do research like this. First, it is always good to go to the web and search for some answers. Things on the internet is always famous and important. Second, for these local affairs, libraries in the community and the city library have the first hand infomation and we need to find them in old newspapers and local history annuals if possible. It is always good to explore things around us and the buildings might be a good start.

你的作文总体上写得不错，但是有一些小问题需要改进。首先，在开头段落中，你应该简要介绍题目的内容，而不是直接进入分析。例如，你可以这样写：“越来越多的人开始对他们居住的房屋或建筑物的历史感兴趣。本文将探讨这一现象背后的原因，并讨论人们如何进行相关研究。”

最后，在结尾段落中，你应该总结文章中的主要信息，并给出你的看法。例如，你可以这样写：“总之，人们对房屋历史的兴趣源自于多种原因。他们可以通过网络搜索和查阅图书馆资料来进行相关研究。”

In some countries, an increasing number of people are becoming interested in discovering the history of the houses or buildings they live in. There are several reasons for this trend.

One reason is that people have a natural curiosity about the past. Living in a historic building or area can spark an interest in learning about the events and people that shaped the local community.

gpt3.5的评价

Based on your essay, I would estimate your IELTS writing score to be around Band 5.0 to 5.5. While you have attempted to answer the question, there are several areas that need improvement:

1. Coherence and cohesion: Your essay lacks a clear structure and organization. You have presented several ideas, but they are not well connected and do not flow logically. It would be better to have a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion that are well linked together.

2. Vocabulary and grammar: There are several errors in vocabulary and grammar, such as "ancesters" instead of "ancestors" and "authenticated" instead of "verified." It is important to use appropriate vocabulary and grammar to convey your ideas accurately and clearly.

3. Examples: Although you have provided some examples of why people are interested in the history of their homes, they are not well developed or supported. It would be better to provide more specific and detailed examples to illustrate your points.

4. Length: Your essay is quite short, and you would benefit from adding more content and details to support your ideas.

To improve your writing, I suggest practicing your grammar and vocabulary skills and working on organizing your ideas more clearly. Additionally, you should try to provide more specific and detailed examples to support your arguments.

Another option is to search online databases, such as census records or property records, which can provide information on past owners and occupants.
