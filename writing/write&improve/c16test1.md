>这是题目：The charts below show the changes in ownership of electrical appliances and amount of time spent doing housework in households in one country between 1920 and 2019. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. Write at least 150 words.

>In the comparision between the hours of housework and the percentage of electrical appliances, we can see a big trend of working hours declining with the population of all kinds of domestic appliances. After a century, the number of hours doing housework per week has gone from approximately 50 hours to 10, which means about 40 hours of housework labour is saved, which is often token by women, that is a huge progress of improvement that the development of technology helps to free human labour.
 The we take a closer look into the data of different catagories of household appliances. First is refrigerator, which is invented around 1920 and rapidly accepted by all families for its irreplacable use of keeping food fresh. Vacuum cleaner is another item that every familly keeps at their home at around 2000. But we can see that the washing machine is until now not been owned 100 percent by all families. And it is also the only appliance that had been through a decline in the 1960s, perhaps caused by energy prise and water shortage. And we can tell that from common sense, some of the clothes are not suitable for machine wash, which is another reason.


>Thank you for sharing your essay with me. Here are some suggestions to help you improve your writing:

 Introduction: Your introduction should provide an overview of the main features of the charts and indicate what comparisons you will be making. However, your introduction does not mention the ownership of electrical appliances, which is a key aspect of the charts. Also, it would be better to start with a clearer thesis statement that summarizes your main points.

 Lack of data: You mention the decline in hours spent on housework, but you do not provide any data to support this claim. It would be better to use specific figures from the charts to illustrate the trend.

 Use of language: There are several grammar and vocabulary mistakes in your essay. For example, "often token" should be "often taken," "that is a huge progress of improvement" should be "which represents significant progress," and "catagories" should be "categories." It is important to proofread your work carefully and use appropriate vocabulary and grammar to convey your ideas clearly.

 Organization: Your essay would benefit from better organization. It is important to separate the different aspects of the charts and focus on each one separately. In addition, you should provide more specific details and examples to support your arguments.

 Overall, your essay shows potential, but there is room for improvement. I hope these suggestions will be helpful in refining your writing.

当然可以。以下是一篇符合雅思7.5分以上标准的作文：

The charts illustrate the changes in ownership of electrical appliances and the amount of time spent on housework in households in one country between 1920 and 2019.

Overall, it is clear that as the ownership of electrical appliances increased, the amount of time spent on housework decreased significantly. In 1920, households spent approximately 50 hours per week on housework, while the ownership of electrical appliances was almost non-existent. By 2019, however, the average time spent on housework had decreased to just 10 hours per week, while the ownership of all types of electrical appliances had reached nearly 100%.

In terms of specific appliances, the refrigerator was the first to be widely owned by households, with ownership reaching 100% by around 1950. The vacuum cleaner followed a similar trend, with ownership reaching 100% by around 2000. The washing machine, on the other hand, experienced a decline in ownership in the 1960s before gradually increasing again. Even by 2019, however, not all households owned a washing machine.

In conclusion, the charts show a clear correlation between the increasing ownership of electrical appliances and the decreasing amount of time spent on housework. This suggests that technological advancements have played a significant role in reducing the burden of housework on households.
