This line graph shows the number of tourists visiting Caribbean island between 2010 and 2017.

It is clear to see the numbers of visitors has trippled in total. In 2010, there are 1 million visitors and the number is 3.5 million by 2017. 

The numbers of visitors shows a steady increase before 2014, with half a million increase each year. After 2014, in the following two years of time, merely no increase can be seen. However, in 2017, a large leap of growing in numbers is shown, pushing the total visitor number to 3.5 million.

The visitors are divided in two catagories, one stay on cruise ships and the other stay on island. 

In 2010, tourists tended to stay on island and the number prevails those stay on cruise ships. But in 2016, the number of people staying on island decreases. More people came to Caribbean on cruise ships and the number is over that on island for the first time. And in 2017 we can see the gap grows larger, to about half a million. 

We are suspecting a continuous growing of people visiting Caribbean and more of them will come over by cruise ships in the future.

The line graph illustrates the number of tourists who visited a Caribbean island between 2010 and 2017.

Overall, it is evident that the total number of visitors tripled during the period shown, from 1 million in 2010 to 3.5 million in 2017.

In terms of the trend, the graph indicates that the number of visitors showed a steady increase before 2014, with an annual increase of around half a million. However, between 2014 and 2016, there was a stagnation in growth, and no significant increase can be seen. Nevertheless, in 2017, there was a considerable surge in the number of tourists, which pushed the total visitor count to 3.5 million.

The tourists can be classified into two categories: those who stay on the island and those who came on cruise ships. In 2010, the majority of the tourists stayed on the island, and the number of visitors who stayed on the island exceeded those who came on cruise ships. However, in 2016, the number of tourists who stayed on the island decreased, and more people came to the Caribbean on cruise ships, and the number of visitors on cruise ships exceeded those who stayed on the island for the first time. The gap between these two categories grew larger in 2017, with the number of visitors arriving on cruise ships exceeding those staying on the island by approximately half a million.

In conclusion, the graph indicates a continuous growth in the number of tourists visiting the Caribbean, with an increasing number of visitors arriving via cruise ships.

## essay2

In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying.


To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

---

There is a growing trend of view for purchasing no newspaper as free news can be achieved online in the futhre. I partly agree with this assertion. I partly agree with this idea. It is a clear picture that everything is turning online, but not all of them are free. 

Firstly, it is a known fact that the printed version of books and newspapers are kind of coming to their ends. As methods for keeping and spreading information and knowledge, paper-based media has made magnificent efforts in human history. With the development of technology, the media itself has also been evolving. Nowadays, the media of knowledge relies heavily on computers and internet, which is a more shared and convinient form of spreading knowledge. People like me would randomly buy some books just to memorize how it was read in the past and newspaper is merely needed, due to it's temporary usage. And there is another use that printed copy should never be totally replaced, which is that it is the natural real copy of the cyber one. In case there are any computer virus and data loss, the printed version is the final rescue.

But can we conclude that everything will be open access online without paying? I don't think so. On the one hand, internet is just another media, like paper, the maintainance would require a certain amount of cost. This underlying cost is often missed when we refer to free of charge as watching free news. It is actually paid through your phone bill. On the other hand, rumors and lies are also spreading over the internet, due to it's conveniency, therefore, we need authorities to publish and take the response for things like book copyright and the genuity of news. Also if we want to have first-hand information, paying is always required. 

To sum up, although in many ways the printed versions of newspapers and books are replaced by online versions, there are still irreplacable usage for printed versions. When it comes to payment, due to the conveniency of internet, the cost for spreading information has been cut down to 
nearly zero. But there is still some money you need to pay for information, especially on high quality ones.

The future of printed newspapers and books is uncertain due to the increasing popularity of online news. While I agree that more and more people are turning to the internet for their news and reading material, I believe that not everything will be available for free online.

It is true that paper-based media has played an important role in human history for keeping and spreading knowledge. However, with the development of technology, the media itself has evolved. Nowadays, people have greater access to knowledge through computers and the internet. While some people still prefer reading printed books, newspapers, and magazines, many are now turning to digital versions for their convenience and accessibility.

However, it is unlikely that everything will be available for free online in the future. The internet is just another medium, and the maintenance and operation of this medium require a certain amount of investment and cost. Although some news websites and publications offer their content for free, many reputable sources require a subscription or payment of some kind to access their content. For example, academic journals and research papers are not available for free online, and people have to pay to access them.

Moreover, it is important to have authorities that can regulate and manage the online content to ensure the genuineness and accuracy of news and information. In addition, printed copies of books and papers have the advantage of being the natural, tangible copies of digital files, and they serve as a backup in case of data loss or computer failure.

In conclusion, while the popularity of online news and reading material is on the rise, it is unlikely that everything will be available for free online in the future. The internet is just another medium, and its maintenance and operation require a certain amount of investment and cost. Additionally, printed copies of books and newspapers have their own advantages and serve as a backup in case of data loss or computer failure. Therefore, both printed and digital media will continue to coexist in the future.
