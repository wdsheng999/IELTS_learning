This diagram illustrates the production of sugar. The process includes growing sugar canes, harvesting, crushing into juice and some fine production to make sugar out of the juice.

First, it starts with the growing of sugar canes. The growing time of sugar cane is between 12 to 18 months. Then farmers should harvest the grown sugar canes either by using special machines or human labour. After harvesting the sugar canes are collected for making juice. All the canes are sent to supression in order to get the sweet juice contains sugar.

Next, the juice is purified in a limestone filter to remove unwanted garbages and fibers firstly. Then the purified juice is heated and turns into syrup through evaporation. Now that the sugar crystals need to be separated by use of centrifuge. Finally the sugar crystals are collected for cooling and drying. After this process the sugar is finally made.

In conclusion, the figure shows the whole process chain of sugar industry. This production not only requires a relatively long time of growing sugar canes, but we can also notice still some amount of human labour force.

你的文章总体上写得不错，结构清晰，内容完整。但是有一些小错误需要注意。

首先，在第二段中，你提到“supression”这个词，但是这个词并不是一个正确的单词。我猜你想表达的是“crushing”或者“pressing”，意思是压榨甘蔗汁。

其次，在第三段中，你提到“garbages”这个词，但是“garbage”这个词是不可数名词，所以不能加复数形式。你可以改成“unwanted garbage and fibers”。

最后，在最后一段中，你提到“still some amount of human labour force”，这里的“still”应该改成“a certain amount of”。

总体来说，你的文章写得很好 7分，只需要注意一些小细节。希望我的建议能够帮助你。😊

The diagram illustrates the process of manufacturing sugar from sugar cane. The process involves several stages, including growing and harvesting the sugar cane, extracting the juice, and refining it to produce sugar.

Initially, sugar cane is grown for a period of 12 to 18 months. Once it has reached maturity, it is harvested either by machine or by hand. The harvested sugar cane is then transported to a facility where it is crushed to extract the juice.

The extracted juice is then purified using a limestone filter to remove any impurities and fibers. The purified juice is then heated and evaporated to produce syrup. The syrup is then placed in a centrifuge to separate the sugar crystals from the liquid.

Finally, the sugar crystals are collected and cooled before being dried. The resulting product is granulated sugar, ready for packaging and distribution.

In conclusion, the diagram provides a detailed overview of the process of manufacturing sugar from sugar cane. It highlights the various stages involved in the process, from growing and harvesting the sugar cane to refining the juice to produce sugar. This process requires not only a significant amount of time but also involves a certain amount of human labor. Overall, this diagram effectively conveys the complexity of the sugar manufacturing process.

## essay2

In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasize that their products are new in some way. 
Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?

In the advertising and bussiness field, people usually emphasize the production is new. Here are some reasons for this phenonmenon and in the end I will give my comments also.

One reason is that the new products are usually more powerful. Usually, the new product will have new functions compared to the old generations and what's more, they are often cheaper. For example, for the consuming electionics, thanks to the Morre's law, new products have better performances so in advertising this is a good point to make.

Another reason is that the salesmen wants to play a little trick to attract potential customers. People like to purchase new things. So if you are not decided, a new products probably make you try to reconsider and one result is that after getting to know more details, anyway, you possibly buy it. 

But I don't think that it is a good strategy for advertising now as more and more new stuff keep to rush into people's life. On the one hand, though new products have more functions, it is less an attractive thing if the old ones already meet the need of customers. On the other hand, old but popular product is actually a proof of good quality and decent design. It is not a bad thing for me to have a product of good use though it has been put into market for a long time. There is also a trend of old fashion, so not only something new is fancy, something old can also be.

In conclusion, the trend of promoting new thing is popular for many reasons. But I don't think this is necessary to say it all the tim

你的文章写得很好，你提出了一些很好的观点。但是，我注意到你的文章中有一些语法和拼写错误。例如，在第一段中，“bussiness”应该拼写为“business”，“phenonmenon”应该拼写为“phenomenon”。此外，你的文章结构也可以改进。例如，在第二段中，你可以将“Usually, the new product will have new functions compared to the old generations and what’s more, they are often cheaper.”改为“Usually, the new product will have new functions compared to the old generations. What’s more, they are often cheaper.”  Moore's law

总体来说，你的文章内容丰富，但是需要注意语法和拼写错误，并改进文章结构。希望我的建议能对你有所帮助。

这是我对你文章的修改建议，希望能帮助你提高写作水平：

In the field of advertising and business, companies often emphasize that their products are new in some way. There are several reasons for this phenomenon, and in my opinion, it has both positive and negative implications.

One reason is that new products often have improved features and capabilities. Compared to older generations, new products may have additional functions and may even be more affordable. For example, in the consumer electronics industry, thanks to Moore’s Law, new products often have better performance. This is a strong selling point in advertising.

Another reason is that companies want to attract potential customers by highlighting the novelty of their products. People are often drawn to new things, so if a customer is undecided, a new product may make them reconsider and ultimately make a purchase.

However, I do not believe that emphasizing novelty is always the best strategy for advertising. As more and more new products flood the market, the novelty factor becomes less attractive if the older products already meet the needs of customers. On the other hand, older but popular products can serve as proof of good quality and design. It is not necessarily a bad thing to have a product that has been on the market for a long time and has proven its usefulness. There is also a trend towards vintage and retro styles, so not only new things can be fashionable - old things can be too.

In conclusion, promoting new products is popular for many reasons. However, I do not think it is necessary to emphasize novelty all the time. Companies should also focus on the quality and usefulness of their products.

题目：In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasize that their products are new in some way. Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?

In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing market, businesses often highlight the novelty of their products in advertising. This phenomenon can be attributed to several reasons and has both positive and negative implications.

One reason for this emphasis on novelty is the desire to attract customers and stand out in a crowded market. With the rapid advancement of technology and increasing competition, businesses need to constantly innovate and offer new and improved products to remain relevant. By emphasizing the new features or improvements of their products, businesses can attract the attention of potential customers and differentiate themselves from their competitors.

However, this constant push for novelty can also have negative consequences. It can create a culture of consumerism, where people feel the need to constantly upgrade and replace perfectly functional products with newer versions. This can lead to unnecessary waste and harm the environment.

In conclusion, while the emphasis on novelty in advertising can help businesses attract customers and remain competitive, it can also have negative consequences. It is important for businesses to balance the desire for innovation with responsible and sustainable practices.
