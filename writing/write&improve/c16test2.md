This diagram illustrates the production of sugar. The process includes growing sugar canes, harvesting, crushing into juice and some fine production to make sugar out of the juice.

First, it starts with the growing of sugar canes. The growing time of sugar cane is between 12 to 18 months. Then farmers should harvest the grown sugar canes either by using special machines or human labour. After harvesting the sugar canes are collected for making juice. All the canes are sent to supression in order to get the sweet juice contains sugar.

Next, the juice is purified in a limestone filter to remove unwanted garbages and fibers firstly. Then the purified juice is heated and turns into syrup through evaporation. Now that the sugar crystals need to be separated by use of centrifuge. Finally the sugar crystals are collected for cooling and drying. After this process the sugar is finally made.

In conclusion, the figure shows the whole process chain of sugar industry. This production not only requires a relatively long time of growing sugar canes, but we can also notice still some amount of human labour force.

你的文章总体上写得不错，结构清晰，内容完整。但是有一些小错误需要注意。

首先，在第二段中，你提到“supression”这个词，但是这个词并不是一个正确的单词。我猜你想表达的是“crushing”或者“pressing”，意思是压榨甘蔗汁。

其次，在第三段中，你提到“garbages”这个词，但是“garbage”这个词是不可数名词，所以不能加复数形式。你可以改成“unwanted garbage and fibers”。

最后，在最后一段中，你提到“still some amount of human labour force”，这里的“still”应该改成“a certain amount of”。

总体来说，你的文章写得很好 7分，只需要注意一些小细节。希望我的建议能够帮助你。😊

The diagram illustrates the process of manufacturing sugar from sugar cane. The process involves several stages, including growing and harvesting the sugar cane, extracting the juice, and refining it to produce sugar.

Initially, sugar cane is grown for a period of 12 to 18 months. Once it has reached maturity, it is harvested either by machine or by hand. The harvested sugar cane is then transported to a facility where it is crushed to extract the juice.

The extracted juice is then purified using a limestone filter to remove any impurities and fibers. The purified juice is then heated and evaporated to produce syrup. The syrup is then placed in a centrifuge to separate the sugar crystals from the liquid.

Finally, the sugar crystals are collected and cooled before being dried. The resulting product is granulated sugar, ready for packaging and distribution.

In conclusion, the diagram provides a detailed overview of the process of manufacturing sugar from sugar cane. It highlights the various stages involved in the process, from growing and harvesting the sugar cane to refining the juice to produce sugar. This process requires not only a significant amount of time but also involves a certain amount of human labor. Overall, this diagram effectively conveys the complexity of the sugar manufacturing process.
