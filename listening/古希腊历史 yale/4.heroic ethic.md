The heroic ethic is the dominant element in the Greek system, to look at this in another way, that this is an aristocratic way of thinking and feeling. The core of it is the arete(德行), this word cause lots of problem because even in antiquity the word means something quite different. In Christianity, which adopted the word as well, the word comes to mean goodness. But when thinking about the world of Homer, it means different things. IN greek, arete derives from anar, which means man, man as oppose to woman. 

So, these are the masculine qualities as the Greek saw them. And primarily among them was the idea of courage, physical courage, mental courage, mainly courage in battle is the core aspect of the word and to be much more encompassing than that. THe most neutral way to translate the word is excellence, prowess(造诣 才智), the ability to do something or to be something which is admired in the fullest way possible.

Some of the examples of arete, are courage, as I said, but also beauty, strength, the ability to perform athletes very well, and the ability to speak very well. It's an extraordinary thing for modern people to see that there are two central heroes, Achilles, the central figure in Iliad, who represent physical strength, power, beauty all of those things, and Odysseus, the hero in Odyssey, he has also got all these things, but the thing that set him apart, that makes him special kind of hero is the skill of speech, which doesn't mean only the pronounce words very well, but rather he is enormously clever, that he can achieve practical ends using speech, just as he uses power and strength.

The Greek regards this just about as well as they do the other. The Odysseus, Homer calls him man of devices, all of these are great and are equally honored along with the physical courage.

The recognition of all the things, the recognition of arete, that the heroes have is what their lives are all about. First of all, they have to have this characteristics but nevertheless, they have to be recognized by people among whom they lived, by the community the live. And the highest rewards the individual can have are the recognition of their fellow men of their high qualities.

We are talking about a society, therefore, the anthropologists have come up with, societies based on shame, as oppose to some practical guilt. Guilt is something very personal. Shame is something that very external and public. And how you are treated and greeted is what makes you worth. So this is the society that community is the critical element which an individual who didn't live in a society could not achieve. THe kinds the glory, fame, recognition, which you expect from a hero.

And all these heroes are aristocrats in the traditional sense of words, they arrived at high standing in their community by virtue of birth. YOu are born to one of these people because your father was such a person belong to the right family.

The noble families of Greece, typically when we saw it in Homer, claim descent from the god and ordinary people do not have. THe family and the individual are the critical elements, but larger range of community are not mentioned like village, entire city, they are barely mentioned. Again we see in Homer, when Achilles refused to fight for Agamemnon, nobody accuses that as treason. Nobody says he is not performing his debt to the community. Everybody, every hero are there to fight because they wanted to be, so that they can earn both the wealth that can be take fron the defeated city, but more important, the kind of fame and glory that comes with such deeds.

We've already known that Achilles made the choice of dying with fame over living forever with no fame. That attitude, that view, even after Greek's time, remains a very important powerful influence on the Greeks throughout the entire history. So that you have built into that society an inherent conflict. After all, even these heroes need community to live for all various purposes that human beings do, so they have allegiance to them, they do, but they also have allegiance to their family and to themselves, which in Homer, the latter tend to be predominate, and yet the sense of conflict is very real, so later you will see that even Achilles to come to terms with the community norms in order to live in a normal life. 

And this conflict, between his family and private desires and needs, and the way of the community, will be characterized strongly of the Greek life for the rest of its history.

Competition, again, is rearing its head, the competition between these two different source of value.
