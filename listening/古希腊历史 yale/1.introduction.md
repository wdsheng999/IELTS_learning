the reason to study ancient greek culture is terribly interesting, but this answer is opposite of objective.
the position of the ancient geeks are at the most significant starting point of the Western civilization. 处于最重要的起点
which is the culture that most powerfully shapes not only the west but most of the world today.

it seems to me to be evident, that what ever it's other characteristics, the West has created institutions of government and law that provide unprecedented freedom for it's people.

it has also invented a body of scientific knowledge and technological achievement that together make possible a level of health and material prosperity undreamed of in earlier times.

Moreover, experience suggests that a society  cannot achieve the full benefits of western science and technology without a commitment to reason and objectivity as essential to knowledge and to the political freedom that sustain it and help it to move forward. 

The primacy of reason and the pursuit of objectivity, therefore, both characteristics of the western experience seem to me to be essential for the achievement of desired goals almost anywhere in the world.

The civilization of the West, however, was not the result of some inevitable process through which other cultures will automatically pass. It emerged from a unique history in which chance and accidence often play vital part. 

The institution and ideas therefore, that improve for freedom and improvement in the material conditions of life can not take root and  flourish without an understanding of how they came about and what challenges they have had to surmount.

The many civilization adopted by the human race have shared basic characteristics. Most have tended cultural uniformity and stability.
Reason, although it was employed for all sorts of practical and intellectual purposes in some of these cultures, still lacked independence from religion and it lacked high status to challenge the most basic received ideas.

Standard form of government has been monarchy. Outside the west, republics have been unknown. Rulers have been thought to be divine, or the appointed spokesman for divinity. Religious and political institutions and beliefs have been thoroughly intertwined as a mutually supportive unified structure.

secular:世俗的 非宗教的
Government has not been subjective to secular reasoned analysis. It is rested on religious authority, tradition, and power. 
The concept of individual freedom has had no importance in the great majority of cultures in human history.

The first and the sharpest break with this common human experience came in ancient Greece. The Greek city states called polis or republics. Differences in wealth among their citizens were relatively small. There were no kings with the wealth to hire mercenary soldiers so the citizens have to do their own fighting and to decide when to fight. As independent defenders of the common safety and the common interest, the demanded a role in the most important political decisions. In this way, for the first time, political life really was invented. Observe the word "political" derives from the Greek word polis. Before that no word was needed because there was no such thing. 

This political life came to be shared by a large proportion of people and participation of political life was highly valued by the ancient Greeks. Such state, of course, does not need a bureaucracy for there were no vast royal or state holdings that need management and not much economic surplus to support a bureaucratic class. There was no separated caste of priests.[casted 种姓 社会地位 社会团体] and very little concern, I don't mean no concern, but very little concern with life after death which was universally important in other civilizations. 

In this varied, dynamic, secular, and remarkably free context, there arose for the first time a speculative natural philosophy based on observation and reason. The root of modern science and technology, free to investigate or to ignore divinity.

What sets the greeks apart is their view of the world. Where other people have seen sameness and continuity, the greeks and the heirs of their way of thinking have tended to notice disjunctions and to make distinctions. The Greek way of looking at the things requires a change from the characteristic way of knowing the things before the greeks, that is to say, the use of faith, poetry and intuition. The greeks increasingly reliance on reason. 
Reason permits a continuing rational inquiring into the nature of reality. Unlike mystical insights, scientific theories cannot be arrived by meditation alone. But require accurate observation of the world and reasoning in a kind that other human being can criticize, analyze, modify and correct. 
enthronement 登基 开端
The adoption of this way of thinking was the beginning of the libration and enthronement of reason to who's searching for examination. The greeks thereafter(之后), exposed everything they perceived(认为感觉注意到意识到), natural, human and divine. 

From the time they were conquered by alien empires, the Greeks also rejected monarchy of any kind. They thought a human being functioning in his full capacity must live as a free man live in a autonomous polios ruled by laws that were the product of the political community.
Not from an arbitrary fiat() from some man or god. These are ideas about laws and justice that have simply not flourished outside of the Western tradition.  

The greeks however combined the unique sense of mankind's high place in the natural order. They combined it with the painful understanding of the limitations of the greatness and the possibilities before man. This combination of the greatness in reality and the possibility of human beings with limitations of it, one great limitation being mortality(mortal 凡人的 mortality 死亡率 终有一死), that together composes() the tragic vision of human condition that characterized in classic Greek civilization. To cope with it, they urged human beings to restrain their overarching(首要的) ambitions. Inscribed at Apollo's temple in Delphi, "know thyselves"  and other statement, "nothing in excess(多余)". 
I think those together really mean this: know your own limitations as a fallible(易犯错误的) mortal, and then exercise moderation(适度) because you are not divine, you are mortal.

Beyond these exhortations(劝勉), they relied on a good political regime(政权) to enable human beings to fullfil the capacities that was part of their nature. To train them in virtue, and to restrain them from vice(v握住n恶习小的adj副的)

Aristotle, and his politics made the point neatly and I quote him. "As man is the best of the animals when perfected, so he is the worst, when separated from law and justice. For injustice is the most dangerous when it's armed, and man armed by nature with good sense and virtue, may use them for entirely opposite ends. Therefore, when he is without virtue, man is the most unscrupulous(肆无忌惮的) and savage of the animals". Aristotle went on to say that the justice needed to control the dark side of human nature. this can be found only in a well-ordered society of free people who govern themselves and the only one he knew was the polis of Greece.

Now the second great strand(主线) in the history of the West is the Judeo Christian tradition, a very different tradition from the one that I just described. Christianity main roots were in Judaism, a religion worshipped a single all powerful deity(), who is sharply separated from the human beings, makes great moral demands upon them, and judges them all, even kings and emperors. Christianity began as a persecuted religion that ultimately captured the Roman Empire only after centuries of hostility towards the secular state in general. It never lost entirely its original character as an insurgent(叛乱的 起义) movement, independent to the state and hostile to it, making claims that challenge the secular society. This too, is unique to the West, just like the Greek is unique, this kind of religious organization is to be found nowhere else in human society. 
So, the union of a universalist religion with a monarch such as the Roman empire, could nonetheless put an end to any prospect of freedom as in other civilizations. But Christianity's inheritance of the rational disputatious greek philosophy lead to powerfully divisive(分裂的) quarrels about the nature of god and other theological questions, which was perfectly in the tradition and uniquely in the tradition of  greek philosophical debate.

Well the people who the Romans called barbarians, destroyed the Roman Empire and also destroyed the power of the emperors and their efforts to impose religious and political conformity under imperial(帝国) control.
