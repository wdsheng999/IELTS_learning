the reason to study ancient greek culture is terribly interesting, but this answer is opposite of objective.
the position of the ancient geeks are at the most significant starting point of the Western civilization. 处于最重要的起点
which is the culture that most powerfully shapes not only the west but most of the world today.

it seems to me to be evident, that what ever it's other characteristics, the West has created institutions of government and law that provide unprecedented freedom for it's people.

it has also invented a body of scientific knowledge and technological achievement that together make possible a level of health and material prosperity undreamed of in earlier times.

Moreover, experience suggests that a society  cannot achieve the full benefits of western science and technology without a commitment to reason and objectivity as essential to knowledge and to the political freedom that sustain it and help it to move forward. 

The primacy of reason and the pursuit of objectivity, therefore, both characteristics of the western experience seem to me to be essential for the achievement of desired goals almost anywhere in the world.

The civilization of the West, however, was not the result of some inevitable process through which other cultures will automatically pass. It emerged from a unique history in which chance and accidence often play vital part. 

The institution and ideas therefore, that improve for freedom and improvement in the material conditions of life can not take root and  flourish without an understanding of how they came about and what challenges they have had to surmount.

The many civilization adopted by the human race have shared basic characteristics. Most have tended cultural uniformity and stability.
Reason, although it was employed for all sorts of practical and intellectual purposes in some of these cultures, still lacked independence from religion and it lacked high status to challenge the most basic received ideas.

Standard form of government has been monarchy. Outside the west, republics have been unknown. Rulers have been thought to be divine, or the appointed spokesman for divinity. Religious and political institutions and beliefs have been thoroughly intertwined as a mutually supportive unified structure.

secular:世俗的 非宗教的
Government has not been subjective to secular reasoned analysis. It is rested on religious authority, tradition, and power. 
The concept of individual freedom has had no importance in the great majority of cultures in human history.

The first and the sharpest break with this common human experience came in ancient Greece. The Greek city states called polis or republics. Differences in wealth among their citizens were relatively small. There were no kings with the wealth to hire mercenary soldiers so the citizens have to do their own fighting and to decide when to fight. As independent defenders of the common safety and the common interest, the demanded a role in the most important political decisions. In this way, for the first time, political life really was invented. Observe the word "political" derives from the Greek word polis. Before that no word was needed because there was no such thing. 

This political life came to be shared by a large proportion of people and participation of political life was highly valued by the ancient Greeks. Such state, of course, does not need a bureaucracy for there were no vast royal or state holdings that need management and not much economic surplus to support a bureaucratic class. There was no separated caste of priests.[casted 种姓 社会地位 社会团体] and very little concern, I don't mean no concern, but very little concern with life after death which was universally important in other civilizations. 

In this varied, dynamic, secular, and remarkably free context, there arose for the first time a speculative natural philosophy based on observation and reason. The root of modern science and technology, free to investigate or to ignore divinity.
