Athens is located in the southeastern portion of the Greek peninsula. MOst of the land is quite barren agriculturally, but there are some places where there are rich soil. THere is a good harbour and most land is not rich because of red soil, which is further turned into great pottery. Some part produces good marble and silver mining. The less productive land is used to produce wine and plant olive trees. 

There are a lot of the migrants from other places to move to Athens and become Athenians because Athens was not declared to be invaded by the Dorians. There is sort of harmony in Athens and nothing like the helot class here. THere is no suppressed population waiting to get at their rulers. So athens is going to be without internal strife.

The society is aristocratic. all that matters is birth, wealth don't play a rule. But in oligarchy wealth does play a rule. As awe see Athens move out of the aristocratic condition into one that is more based on wealth than it is merely on birth.

Aristotle tells us in 683B.C., magistrates are chosen from the aristocracy to do various jobs in the cities. One of these is the War archon(统治官，执政官 雅典九人执政之一), he was the most important. The second archon gives the name of the year after him. The greeks don't have a system of dating. they name the year after the magistrate of the state. So that archon is called the man who gives his name to the state. A third archon was known as the king archon. His responsibility is mainly religious. Then there is a group of six men whose function were judicial. People could go for specific purposes. All men of the 9 archons are referred to as the college of nine archons(九执政官之院), they had a secretary, which brought the number up to ten. They were elected by the assembly of all Athenian adult male, which were mainly not aristocrats, they chose from the aristocrats for those archons.

The archons serve for one year and not again. Nobody in Athens holds an office at this time for more than a year. THe only thing in town in continuity that can develop power and influence over a period of time, is the council of the Areopagus(战神山议事会). THat's what aristocratic and oligarchic regimes do. They are very nervous about individuals who acquire too much power, popularity, influence, which will threaten the character of the aristocracy. Aristocracy--this may seem funny--but aristocracy loves equality, equality among aristocrats, and then tremendous inequality between them and everybody else.

An aristocratic republic is what we have. Not a monarchy but republic. Dominated insofar(在。。状况下) as it's dominated by anybody but individual aristocrats, by the Areopagus. THe council members are actually consisted of men who have been archon, the year after their archonship, they automatically go into the council and remain there for life.

Then it comes to Athens as it did to every other state, later it looks like in Athens. It grows slowly and late, but it begins to engage in commerce to a greater degree than before. And as handcrafts manufacturing, which leads to new wealth and new class distinctions, which are now based not on birth, but on wealth. The Athenians divided people in different classes, one of them was the wellborn, in ancient time there were only class either were or not. But now we hear about people called cavalryman. You can't have a horse unless you have a lot of money. At the bottom of the barrel(社会底层), we hear about people called thetes(雇工), they are poor, they don't own land. They live at the mercy of chance, they work for other people. They do anything they can to stay alive. But now comes the new thing. They were men who could own a pair of oxen so they were well sufficient enough to make them respectably well of farmers. This new class of independent family farmer has arisen in Athens.

As in other states, they were not satisfied with the position in the state as his own importance to the state becomes greater and greater. 

The next change is not happen but it would change history if so. According to tradition in the year of 632bc, an athenian nobleman who become famous because of his victory in the athletic contest and married a daughter of a tyrant near Athens, so this young man was a big shot of extraordinary character named Cylon, attempted to establish a tyranny in Athens. but he couldn't and was defeated. THough it failed, unlike in many states in Greece, this is a waning about troubles ahead.
