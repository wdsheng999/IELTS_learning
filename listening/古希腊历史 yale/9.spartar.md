When coming to Sparta you are coming to a polis lifted to a new level in the sense of all the theoretical elements and psychological elements that go into creating a polis is intensified in Sparta to such a degree that is almost a different thing. And it is important that the other Greeks felt that way too. Sparta has a special place in their minds, in their imaginations. THey admired the Sparta very much because the Sparta carried the feeling that the polis was the center of a Greek man's life. and it had a virtue that were associated to the polis to an extraordinary degree.

They admired it much but not so much to live like a Spartan because the price was very high indeed. One other thing we need to take a look at the way the Spartans lived was that they became a sort of a model for the philosophers in 4 to 5th century B.C., I mean certainly Plato and Aristotle who had some criticisms of the real Sparta that existed.

It is fact that the Sparta would emerge in the 6th century as the most powerful of the polis. First we need to take a look at how Sparta became the most powerful among Greece.

As the beginning of Sparta, there was slaves called helots(黑洛士) do the farming and other people who would do the bronze and iron. Sparta don't do anything else than fighting. 

两次美西尼亚战争 got a lot of slaves. ANd only after the second Messnia war, the Sparta constitution comes into being. What is established in this constitutional ultimate reform is to make Sparta like no other state in the Greek world, and perhaps unlike any states around the world, and to make it the subject of attention and interest about the Spartan way of life that make them take it seriously and admire it. 

One of the things I don't want to lose sight is that Sparta becomes a slave holding state like no other state in Greece. Now, there was slavery all over the ancient world, there was no nation in the ancient world that was without slavery. ANd there was certainly nothing like what Spartans did, that to have a system of life that allowed the Spartan citizens not to work in order to live. No other states would have it. If you look at the slavery system in 7th century B.C., that the farmers would do the labor in the field, perhaps with one or two slaves that they owned assisting them, that's not the Spartan system. The Sparta system will be the Spartans at home, training constantly for their military purposes. The slavery like in the antebellum south in the US.类似南北战争之前打南方奴隶制度
