The Dark Ages and the world of Homer

can we seek any historical information in Homer's poems at all?

The period between the Bronze Age and the emergence of the polis--most of it involves inferences from our understanding of what Homeric poems tell us. But I think we need to take a hard look at what we can do.

"Ironically, the more Homer exaggerates, the more authentic he is about the Bronze Age."

I think there is a widespread consensus among most of the people that study teh subject. That doesn't mean the consensus is correct. Not all of these opinions are shared by the same number, by no means, of the scholars, some of them are fall out. I would say the one that says you can't learn anything from this is an outlier(离群值). The notion that this is about the Mycenaean is an outlier and then I would say you get the largest consensus is something like the Finley's consensus, but people verging in both directions from that. What you'll hear from me, is essentially that consensus point of view. It strikes me as being better supported than the others, but we really have to keep an open mind because in this prehistorical period, you have to be very modest about what you think you know about it. Almost everything is inferences and judgement and very little is anythings you want to call proof. But those warnings are what I tell you sort of what I think most people think about this. 

First of all, if we want to know the Dark Ages, what resources do we have available to us? Of course, I've already mentioned the poems of Homer turns out to be a very large source for what most people look to.

Secondly, there are legends the Greeks told about their early history which come down to us in later sources and they are available. And the question is should we use them at all? and if we do how carefully should we be? This is a good time to make confession so that you know how to judge what I say all through the course.

Prior to the 18 century, when the German scholars start to look at the Homer's poems specifically very carefully and skeptically, and to make suggestions that the poems we have really not to be thought of as the work of a single poet, Homer, who had written it altogether. But who began to divide them up into early and late elements, which I thought drove the field of classics insane for about 100 years. And it began the critical study of the poems for the first time. And critical methods were applied and it became common to reject any ancient story that wasn't really nailed down very firmly by some device.

...the position of scholarship to which we call the Higher Naivete. The way is works is, you start out, you don't know anything, you're naive, you believe everything. Next, you go to college education and you don't believe anything, and then you reach the level of wisdom, the Higher Naivete, and you know what to believe even though you can't prove it....

So, I think the way to deal with legend is to regard them as different from essentially sophisticated historical statements but as possibly deriving from facts, which have obviously been distorted and misunderstood, misused and so on, but it will be reckless, it seems to me, to just put them aside and not asking yourself a question, " Can there be something believable at the root of this?"

And just to  give you some small defense of that approach, I always like to ask students "Supposing we don't have a single historical record, no newspaper, no diaries. You know nothing totally reliable for what happened in the latter part of the nineteenth century in America. Would we know anything about what happened?" Of course we would. We would know that there was a revolution against Britain. I'm sure that French assisted in that.... Those are easy, there's no getting around reading those things. Then it gets to be more interesting as we speculate....So the hard job would be to select among these legendary things to see what fact can be found, that will never be easy or deadly certain. That's what I'm talking about here. 

Finally, there is the sources that people who are skeptical most like to believe because it's tangible. I'm talking about archaeology, which is the discovery and examination and evaluation of material evidence, not in writing, the actual remains of places where they live, the implements that they use and so on. The beauty of that is that it's objective, it's not something that somebody imagined. But you should derived as much confidence from it as lots of archaeologists like to, because it's only a thing until you say what it means, until you put a date on it, until you try to understand what it really is, what it function is, who brought it there, who left it there. All the things you have to reason out from all the evidence, all the information we can get. So it's an astonishing amount of speculation involved in establishing this apparently rigorous objective technique. We certainly need to use it as we should use is carefully as we use everything else.But it is indeed very valuable in studying a world before our time, always.

Now, we mentioned how important the poems are, so, we need to take a look at what they are and how we know about them and so on. 

I mentioned to you that Iliad and Odyssey were known in the Western world continuously from the time that they were made available. So they were known and they were very important to those people who know about it, but I also mentioned last time the impact of Schliemann's excavations, which turned everything around. The hyper-skeptical point of view taken by scholars in Europe in the nineteenth century was eroded(侵蚀) sharply by the discovery of places and so the story couldn't have been simple inventions and that began a new phase in the story. 

And, again, there was certain stunning physical resemblances between what Homer said and what we could see. The palaces were like the palaces he described. and a lot of things, such like weapons and implements are squared with what was found in Mycenae...(as how chariot is used in war of Bronze age like tanks, ) and you would break the enemies line and give the other side an opportunity to wreak havoc(严重破坏) with their army. But in Homer's description the heroes use the chariot in a different way... Homer's view is much of the most, of what we are told about the Homeric world comes, as he says, 

One other thing is that many a scholar is very reluctant to admit that there is any Mycenaean stuff here although they cannot fail to concede that some of the implement found at Mycenaean sites are precisely like what Homer says.

Now the differences between what we find in the Homer's poems are also very illuminating. Differences between that and the world after the fall of the Mycenaean world. For instance, one of the most striking things you find in cultures anthropologists and archaeologists live off (live off 以。。为生)this, is what they do with bodies. In Mycenae, it's obvious that they bury them in the ground but we know that Greeks in Homer don't do that.

And here's another critical element of the story. We know that Mycenaeans, or at least some amount of them, could write. Because we have the Linear B script, which we can read. There is no clue, that there is such a thing as writing in the Homeric poems. There's only one very abstruse(深奥的难懂的) clue about somebody seems to know something about it. But fundamentally it's an illiterate society and that is a major difference.

Still now there are poets who lived in Yugoslavia in the mountains and the backwoods(未开垦的荒地，森林深处) where there still has these bards around. Those bards created sort of epic narratives of considerable length in which they still tell the same stories in verses and music and you could recognize the story as you went from bard to bard but every bard added and subtracted things to suit his own talents. That the idea of the game.

Then Perry demonstrated by careful scholarship of the Homeric poems that that is the way the Homeric poems, I would use the word stitched together, because in the ancient Greek world the people who sang, recited, created the poems of the Homeric epics were called rhapsodes. 吟诵者  bard吟游诗人
