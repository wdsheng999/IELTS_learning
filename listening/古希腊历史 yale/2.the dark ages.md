I want to to talk to you about the beginnings of the greek experiences as far as we know it, and I should warn you at once, the further back in history you go, the less secure is your knowledge, especially at the beginning of our talk today, when you are in a truly prehistoric period.That is before there is any written evidence from the period in which you are interested. So, what we think we know, derives chiefly from the archeological evidence, which is before writing--mute evidence that has to be interpreted and is very complicated and is far from secure. Even a question such as date, which is so critical for the historians. It is really quite approximate and subject to controversy, as is just about every single thing I will tell you for the next few days will be even more than usual, subject to controversy about the most fundamental things. So, what you will hearing are approximations as best we can make them of what's going on.

Well, we begin our story with the emergence of the Bronze Age in the Aegean Sea area. That appears to have taken place about 3000 B.C. I think these days they date it down to about another century to about 2900 B.C. Precision is impossible, don't worry about that. And what we find, the first thing about the Bronze Age, and I use the word civilization now for the first time, because before the Bronze Age, there is nothing that we would define as civilization. 

Civilization involves the establishment of permanent dwelling areas that we call cities, as opposed to villages. Agricultural villages will have existed all over the place in the late Stone Age and the Neolithic Period(新石器时代), as it is known. But there is a difference, and the critical difference is that a city contains a number of people who do not provide their own support, that is to say they don't produce food. They need to acquire it from somebody else. Instead, they do various things like govern and are priest, are bureaucrats, and are engaged in other non-productive activities that depend upon others to feed them. That's the narrowest definition of cities. Of course, with cities we typically find a whole association of cultural characteristics which we deem as civilization. Well that's what we see for the first time in the Aegean area on the island of Crete. That civilization was discovered by the archaeologists right at the time of the twentieth century. Sir Arthur Evans, as Englishman, was responsible for the major work that has revealed that civilization. He was captivated(吸引) at one point that I think he convinced himself that he was the descendant of the kings of that civilization. 

But anyway, he named it after the legendary king of Crete who appears in Greek mythology by the name of Minos. So he referred to that civilization as the Minoan civilization. And when we use the word Minoan we mean the civilization who's home is Crete. It spreads beyond Crete, because the Minoans established what we might now call it Empire in various part of Mediterranean. It starts with Crete, it's a Bronze Age culture, and it's the first civilization we know in the area. What we find in the Minoan civilization, chiefly we can learn about the civilization from was the city of Knossos, located on the northern shore of Crete, where a great palace complex was discovered. When you visited that sight and draw the conclusions that are inevitable from examining it, you realize that they look and seem very much like older civilizations that grown in the Near East, the real sort of typical home of the kinds of things we talking about is Mesopotamia, modern Iraq, the Tigress, Euphrates Valley, spread out beyond Iraq and  went up to Syria and neighboring places. It, too, was very similar to the civilization apparently newer in the Nile Valley in Egypt, about which we know a great deals more than we know about the Minoan, because as you know it, in the nineteenth century scholars discovered how to read the languages that were written in Egypt and in Mesopotamia.
