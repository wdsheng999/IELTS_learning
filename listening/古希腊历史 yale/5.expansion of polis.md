The story of the hawk and the nightingale illustrates really the doctrine of the might over the right. THe hawk says he is a fool that tries to match his strength with the stronger, he will loose the battle, and with the shame will hurt also. So don't try to fight against stronger people is what he said.

It is better, he says, to go by the path leading to justice. For when justice is outraged, and by the way justice here is personified in the form of the goddess called  Dike, she follows before us weeping to the polis, and the gathering of people. SHe puts a dark myth upon her and brings a curse upon all those who drive her out, who deal in(做某买卖) her and twist her in dealing.

The lines that Hesiod writes in the poems shows that the polis is there already. There is no way talking about what he is talking about in the kinds of settlements that existed before the invention of the polis, and that I think is worth mentioning.

Beyond that, the fact is that for the Greeks that early and always--btw it remains so, the notion of justice is directly connected with polis. THe only place where justice exists or can only exists is in a polis. The only way you can live a good life is when you live in a polis. And when you do live in a polis of course, you have to behave justly, and this is tremendously important, because your behavior doesn't just affect just you and your family, it involves the entire community. Remember even one bad man can ruin a polis by the punishment for god.

That is a strong statement about the priority of the community and that is very different from the values we saw in the Iliad and Odyssey. YOU cannot imagine in the world Hesiod describes that Achilles or anybody says if you insulted me so I will not fight for my polis. That can be inconceivable in this type of world.

Now given this information, we are onto the problem that for the Greek polis for rest of its history and it's really a problem to this very day for all people who live in some sort of a civilized community. How to reconcile(conciliate安抚 reconcile和解) the interests and desires and wellbeing of the individual and his immediate family with those of the community at large. They may seem, and probably might even be said to be, different and antagonistic(对抗的) at some point and when they are what should you do? FOr the Greeks the answer was pretty clear hereafter, one ought and should be interested to take actions on behalf of the polis.

And here are some examples that show the poets fairly early thought the polis was for and about and the relationship between individual and polis. In this case I'm talking about Herodotus, who very early in his history tells a story of his visit to Lydia, the land of the great tyrant Croesus, who is also the richest man in the world.

So on goes visits Croesus, Croesus asked Solon, who is the most happiest, the most fortunate-- both of those things contained in the word he uses-- that he had ever seen. Solon was now a man of full years, he was a man greatly respected, he turned out to be one of the seven sages that the ancient greeks selected for the wisest man who ever lived. SO it would be very interested to know what he thought about that. Of course, Croesus had shown his wealth to Solon, in my view, he put the question in this way, Solon, as he looked around at his fabulous wealth and great good fortune. Solon answers, Tells of Athens, who is unknown to anybody else outside Athens. Croesus was astonished, and he asked why Solon select Tells and here is what Herodotus says:

First, because his city is flourishing, that is his polis, and he himself had sons both beautiful and good.
