The story of the hawk and the nightingale illustrates really the doctrine of the might over the right. THe hawk says he is a fool that tries to match his strength with the stronger, he will loose the battle, and with the shame will hurt also. So don't try to fight against stronger people is what he said.

It is better, he says, to go by the path leading to justice. For when justice is outraged, and by the way justice here is personified in the form of the goddess called  Dike, she follows before us weeping to the polis, and the gathering of people. SHe puts a dark myth upon her and brings a curse upon all those who drive her out, who deal in(做某买卖) her and twist her in dealing.

The lines that Hesiod writes in the poems shows that the polis is there already. There is no way talking about what he is talking about in the kinds of settlements that existed before the invention of the polis, and that I think is worth mentioning.

Beyond that, the fact is that for the Greeks that early and always--btw it remains so, the notion of justice is directly connected with polis. THe only place where justice exists or can only exists is in a polis. The only way you can live a good life is when you live in a polis. And when you do live in a polis of course, you have to behave justly, and this is tremendously important, because your behavior doesn't just affect just you and your family, it involves the entire community. Remember even one bad man can ruin a polis by the punishment for god.

That is a strong statement about the priority of the community and that is very different from the values we saw in the Iliad and Odyssey. YOU cannot imagine in the world Hesiod describes that Achilles or anybody says if you insulted me so I will not fight for my polis. That can be inconceivable in this type of world.

Now given this information, we are onto the problem that for the Greek polis for rest of its history and it's really a problem to this very day for all people who live in some sort of a civilized community. How to reconcile(conciliate安抚 reconcile和解) the interests and desires and wellbeing of the individual and his immediate family with those of the community at large. They may seem, and probably might even be said to be, different and antagonistic(对抗的) at some point and when they are what should you do? FOr the Greeks the answer was pretty clear hereafter, one ought and should be interested to take actions on behalf of the polis.

And here are some examples that show the poets fairly early thought the polis was for and about and the relationship between individual and polis. In this case I'm talking about Herodotus, who very early in his history tells a story of his visit to Lydia, the land of the great tyrant Croesus, who is also the richest man in the world.

So on goes visits Croesus, Croesus asked Solon, who is the most happiest, the most fortunate-- both of those things contained in the word he uses-- that he had ever seen. Solon was now a man of full years, he was a man greatly respected, he turned out to be one of the seven sages that the ancient greeks selected for the wisest man who ever lived. SO it would be very interested to know what he thought about that. Of course, Croesus had shown his wealth to Solon, in my view, he put the question in this way, Solon, as he looked around at his fabulous wealth and great good fortune. Solon answers, Tellus of Athens, who is unknown to anybody else outside Athens. Croesus was astonished, and he asked why Solon select Tellus and here is what Herodotus says:

First, because his city is flourishing, that is his polis, and he himself had sons both beautiful and good. And finally fought to death at most gallantly against the enemy. To summarize, the happiest, the most fortunate man was a dead Athenian that nobody ever heard of. Why? we see in this passage something that reveal so much the Greeks value war and you'll see how closely they were tied up with the polis and the primacy of the polis in their lives. 

Well, why are all the things good? First, his city runs well, a man living in a city not functioning well is impossible to be happy. Second, sons. since the Greeks do not believe in immortality, how do you find what everybody wants? One way is through family. So to speak, if you have sons and they are healthy, and they do well, and they have children, that means your name will be carried into the future. and that is one form of immortality. BUt the greatest type of immortality is the story Achilles and his fellow heroes which is to fight for your city, and when you died fighting nobly for your polis, you memory will last so long as the polis lasted.

Final document comes from precisely the poems of Solon. As we shall see Solon is a very important figure in Athens, and at a critical moment in Athenian history, the Athenians will give the honor and the responsibility of being the sole public official to draw a new constitutional laws for Athens, an enormously important job. And in the course of defending himself against the attacks after he had done it, he wrote what really amount to political pamphlets to defend his actions and to set forth the ideas that lay under the actual laws that he had put forward.

It's worth pointing out that the the poems are better device for remember than prose, which is the way to let people remember and spread and so they did last in history. Here is a fragment of Solon's poems:
 "So, the public ruin, invades the house of every citizen, and the courtyard doors no longer have strength to keep it away, but it overleaps the lofty wall and though a man runs in and tries to lock it in a chamber or closet, it ferrets(搜索) him out. SO my sprits dictates to me, I must tell the Athenians how many evils a city suffers from bad government" The greek word for that is Dysnomia, and good government, Eunomia, "displays all neatness and order, and many times, she must put shackles on the breakers of laws" 

 "An Eunomia levels rough places, stops glut and greed, takes the force from violence. She dries up the growing flowers of despair as thy grow, she straightens out crooked judgments, gentles the swollen ambitions and puts an end to acts of divisional strife. She stills the gall of wearisome hate and under her influence, all life among mankind is harmonious and does well."

Wonderful. Where do all these good things come from, are they from god? No, they come from the polis, when its laws are good, and therefore when the government it provides is eunomia rather than the opposite.

He is making a claim here, which is a powerful one, but which was characteristic of Greeks. The laws that the polis have is not merely a negative thing like todays, which is prevent wrong doing and punish wrong doing. THe laws in a polis makes its citizen better,, not only defeats wrong, but it creates rights.

Now lets talk about citizens, in greek, politas. As we mentioned, all of us have this natural selfishness when we are born. We all seek our own interests and soon we join up with a family and we want the family's interest up to a point, and how is this fits a community in large? A problem the Greeks always wrestled with. To conclude, Pericles delivered a great deal of thought to this problem and present the best argument he could think of for solving this problem which was to claim that the individual's highest needs, and great family and personal goals, could only be met through the polis. And his well being was tied up inextricably(难解难分) with the well being of the polis. 

Now, we don't have to buy that and individualism undoubtedly found the strain too much from time to time, but what's interesting, is rather the ideal, the claim, the theory. You cannot truly achieve what you want without being an active and loyal citizen of this great community which you need to achieve what you want in life.

It is a claim already and as you've seen in Aristotle towards the end history of the free polis. It's something necessary for mankind. It is the center of Pericles' life and it explains the Greeks' devotion to the independence, to the autonomy of the polis and their desire to beautify the polis and make it as great as it could possibly be. All that sounds very nice, it certainly had very nice aspects to it, but there  was of course downsides as well, which is every polis wants to be great, and being Greeks, they wanted to be greater than the neighbors. THat involves conflicts and often among the Greeks involved war.

Now Greeks were not unique in history in constantly being ar war
